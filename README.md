Image Segmentation using CT Scan data

The scope and the intent for the GlassJaw project for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to use Machine Learning as a tool to locate and auto-segment medical scans to help assist with VSPâ€™s and design implants for cranio-maxillofacial surgeries. Our team has implemented an unsupervised learning approach to create labels using Python by adopting methods such as k-means clustering.
This method uses thresholding to filter out the mandible part of the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) to locate the specific area of interest such as a particular region of the bone through labeling each segmented part. The team had also gone further and developed on this by using automatic segmentation based supervised learning through convolutional neural networks (CNN).
